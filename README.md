 ## 2.1 Overview of FLoS
The “Fix Localisation System” (FLoS) is a web application that automates the testing process for detecting
localization in a mobile application and provides fixes for the issues. It handles localization for both text
and media content (audio, video & image). It has three modules which are registration & login for
creating an account, project handling module for creating projects & controlling access to it and finally
test & fix localization module. The modules are described below:
### 2.1.1 Registration & Login
A user needs to sign up for creating an account and to do that, he needs to enter his username(unique),
email, password and additional information (e.g company name). To verify the email address, an OTP is
generated and sent to the mail. The user needs to enter that OTP to confirm his email address.
If the user forgets his password and wants to recover his account, an OTP is generated and sent to the
email address for that account. The user needs to enter that OTP to authenticate his identity and now, he
can create a new password for his account. Note that, the users can change their user information
anytime after logging in.
